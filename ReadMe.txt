- First I set up a scanner to allow user input.
- Next I created a file scanner to scan the file for the  
data I needed to display.
- The program displays a menu and asks the user for   
input.
- A switch statement is used to select the correct menu   
item.
- If the user selects '1' they enter a stock name and the 
program compares it to the data in the file. Then it    
displays a stock and price if a match is found.
- For '2' the user enters a price and the program     
compares the prices to the data file and prints out if    
the number is higher or equal than the price of the     
stock.
- For '3' the program says "Goodbye" and exits.
- All other numbers cause an error message to read.
- I made the program so it won't accept bad stock names.
- The program works with negatives as well.
- If I could change anything I'd try to condense the     
program down. I think it might be excessive but I'm not   
totally sure.
